# tic-tac-toe

The objective of this project is to use the module/IIFE pattern to minimize global code.

TODO: 

1. Refactor the terrible code responsible for determining win conditions
2. Maybe implement draw conditions
3. Implement AI to play against
4. Implement minimax algorithm for an unbeatable AI option
